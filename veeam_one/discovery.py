"""Detect which REST API version, and port, a Veeam ONE server offers.

The REST API has no endpoint that reports the set of versions a server supports, and
nothing negotiates it for the caller — the version is part of every path, so a client picks
one up front and lives with it.

That path is what makes detection possible without credentials. ``/api/{version}/about``
exists in every version and requires a bearer token, so an anonymous probe distinguishes
the two cases cleanly:

* the server serves that version — routing matches and authentication rejects it: 401
  (or 403, or 200 on a deployment that does not gate it)
* the server does not serve that version — Veeam ONE answers 400 (a proxy may say 404)

A Veeam ONE 13 server serves older versions too (2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 all answer 401), so
``detect_api_version`` intersects the versions that answer with the versions this package
can actually speak (``VERSION_TO_PACKAGE``) and returns the newest. The answer is always
something the caller can pass straight to ``VeeamClient``.

Detection is best-effort by contract. A server can be unreachable, behind a proxy that
rewrites statuses, or reject the probe for a reason of its own, and all of those return None
so a caller falls back to a version of its own choosing rather than failing outright.
